 ## Description

 ---
Upon signing up and creating an account, users can input their personal information, including their name, date of birth, and biography. The program also provides a convenient family tree UI where users can input and organize information about their family members.

Using the intuitive family tree UI, users can easily add family members by creating nodes within the tree. Each family member's node can be clicked on to access and view their specific information. This includes details such as their name, date of birth, and any additional information provided by the user. Users can effortlessly navigate and explore their family tree, gaining insights into their family connections and relationships.

With the ability to add family members as required, this MVC program offers a flexible and customizable platform for users to document and visualize their family history. It simplifies the process of managing and accessing family-related information, providing a comprehensive and user-friendly experience for individuals looking to explore and understand their family lineage.
